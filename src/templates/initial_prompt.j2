Your task is to generate a Heroes of Might and Magic 3 map.
Follow the "MapTemplate" specification for required fields.

### What to do:
1. Create a complete map scenario:
   - Define story and objectives (fun to play + role-play).
   - Design player starting zones, progression zones, and end-game zones.
   - Add zone connections.

2. Apply these rules:
   - Zones and zone connections are mandatory.
   - Each map seed must produce a different layout.
   - Use as many zones as possible for the given map size.
   - Starting zones must contain at least:
       - 1 Ore mine
       - 1 Wood mine
   - Gold mines are rare compared to other mines.
   - All players must have fair access to all mines within reasonable distance of their town.
   - Use "wide" connections frequently.
   - If objectives allow, enable underground zones.
   - Place players fairly: equal distance and balanced encounters.
   - Treasure rules:
       - Starting zones: max 2 treasures.
       - Other zones: 2â€“3 treasures recommended.
       - High-value treasure (e.g. value 10000+) can be used to give players starting artifacts, but keep density low for artifacts.
       - For lower valued treasure you can increase the density (keep <12 for starting zones).
       - Place some low cost treasure in the starting zones (<5000).
       - When adding custom objects also think about other random objects that should be placed in the zone.
   - Consider map size: smaller maps = smaller zones = fewer buildings.

3. Use these inputs:
   - Map size: {{ map_size }}
   - Number of players: {{ players }}
   - Human players: {{ humans }}
   - Random seed: {{ seed }}
   - Map specifics (optional): {{ freeform }}

### Output:
For the first response, output only: "MapTemplate" struct
