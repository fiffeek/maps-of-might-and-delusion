Your task is to generate a Heroes of Might and Magic 3 map.
Follow the "MapTemplate" specification for required fields.

### What to do:
1. Create a complete map scenario:
   - Define story and objectives (fun to play + role-play).
   - Design player starting zones, progression zones, and end-game zones.
   - Add zone connections. They are required.

2. Apply these rules:
   - Zones and zone connections are mandatory.
   - Each map seed must produce a different layout.
   - Use as many zones as possible for the given map size.
   - Starting zones must contain at least:
       - 1 Ore mine
       - 1 Wood mine
   - Gold mines are rare compared to other mines.
   - All players must have fair access to all mines within reasonable distance of their town.
   - If objectives allow, enable underground zones.
   - Place players fairly: equal distance and balanced encounters.
   - Treasure rules:
       - Starting zones: max 3 treasures. Use at least two different settings.
       - Other zones: 2â€“3 treasures recommended, can be more. Use at least two different settings.
       - High-value treasure (e.g. value 10000+) can be used to give players starting artifacts, but keep density low for artifacts.
       - For lower valued treasure you can increase the density (keep <12 for starting zones).
       - Place some low cost treasure in the starting zones (<8000).
       - When adding custom objects also think about other random objects that should be placed in the zone.
       - To not repeat the same treasure rules in different zones you can use "treasureLikeZone"
   - Consider map size: smaller maps = smaller zones = fewer buildings.
   - Use the map size as informative means in terms of how many tiles there are to define how many zones to place, nothing else.
   - Use "minesLikeZone" to not repeat the same mines configuration in different zones.
   - Add some treasure in junctions too.
   - When asked for "more treasure" add another entry to the treasure array, or/and adjust the density.
   - Prefer "normal" mosters in the starting player zones if there is lots of resources (treasure and mines)

3. Use these inputs:
   - Map size: {{ map_size }}
   - Number of players: {{ players }}
   - Human players: {{ humans }}
   - Random seed: {{ seed }}
   - Map specifics (optional): {{ freeform }}

4. For custom objects:
   - You do **not** need to use all available `custom_objects` types.
   - Only include the ones you want to adjust (to make them appear or disappear). The defaults are sane.
   - To not repeat custom objects in different zones use "customObjectsLikeZone" field (this effectively copies custom_objects from one zone to another)
   - If you want a specific object to disappear (not the entire category) just set its value to 99999.
   - If you want to limit the object numbers inside a given zone set "zoneLimit"
   - If you want an object to absolutely appear increase its rarity to 200 and set "zoneLimit" to not spam it.
   - The higher the rarity the more common the object is.
   - Use pandorasBox really scarcely.
   - When putting an object in "commonObjects" also ban it in "bannedObjects" (due to VCMI bug).
   - Limit pandorasBox to 1 in high value zones, ban elsewhere.

5. Here are some examples for the treasure to get a feel of the possible values. Do not use these but look at how values and density plays a role:
- Starting zones:
  - Example:
    { "min" : 10000, "max" : 15000, "density" : 1 },
    { "min" : 3000, "max" : 6000, "density" : 6 }
  - Example:
    { "min" : 300, "max" : 2000, "density" : 18 },
		{ "min" : 3000, "max" : 5000, "density" : 6 }
  - Example:
    { "min" : 500, "max" : 3000, "density" : 10 },
    { "min" : 3000, "max" : 6000, "density" : 8 },
    { "min" : 1000, "max" : 2000, "density" : 5 }
  - Example:
    { "min" : 400, "max" : 2000, "density" : 6 },
    { "min" : 3500, "max" : 5000, "density" : 5 },
    { "min" : 2100, "max" : 3000, "density" : 2 }
  - Example:
    { "min" : 300, "max" : 3000, "density" : 12 },
    { "min" : 5000, "max" : 9000, "density" : 6 }
  - Example:
    { "min" : 12000, "max" : 22000, "density" : 1 },
    { "min" : 5000, "max" : 16000, "density" : 6 },
    { "min" : 400, "max" : 3000, "density" : 4 }
  - Example:
    { "min" : 3300, "max" : 3500, "density" : 4 },
    { "min" : 1000, "max" : 2000, "density" : 7 },
    { "min" : 330, "max" : 1000, "density" : 3 }
  - Example:
    { "min" : 14000, "max" : 18000, "density" : 1 },
    { "min" : 5000, "max" : 7500, "density" : 3 },
    { "min" : 340, "max" : 2000, "density" : 9 }
  - Example:
    { "min" : 400, "max" : 2000, "density" : 6 },
    { "min" : 3500, "max" : 5000, "density" : 5 },
    { "min" : 2100, "max" : 3000, "density" : 2 }

- "treasure" zones:
  - Example:
    { "min" : 5000, "max" : 12500, "density" : 2 },
    { "min" : 3000, "max" : 6000, "density" : 8 },
    { "min" : 300, "max" : 2000, "density" : 12 }
  - Example:
    { "min" : 100, "max" : 1400, "density" : 17 },
    { "min" : 3000, "max" : 4000, "density" : 5 }
  - Example:
    { "min" : 800, "max" : 4000, "density" : 8 },
    { "min" : 5000, "max" : 8000, "density" : 12 },
    { "min" : 10000, "max" : 15000, "density" : 5 }
  - Example:
    { "min" : 100, "max" : 1500, "density" : 6 },
    { "min" : 2000, "max" : 3000, "density" : 8 },
    { "min" : 5000, "max" : 9000, "density" : 7 }
  - Example:
    { "min" : 10000, "max" : 15000, "density" : 1 },
    { "min" : 5000, "max" : 7000, "density" : 30 },
    { "min" : 300, "max" : 3000, "density" : 5 }
  - Example:
    { "min" : 25000, "max" : 30000, "density" : 10 },
    { "min" : 300, "max" : 3000, "density" : 10 }
  - Example:
    { "min" : 35000, "max" : 55000, "density" : 3 },
    { "min" : 25000, "max" : 35000, "density" : 10 },
    { "min" : 10000, "max" : 25000, "density" : 10 }
  - Example:
    { "min" : 5000, "max" : 7000, "density" : 8 },
    { "min" : 1500, "max" : 2000, "density" : 2 },
    { "min" : 330, "max" : 1500, "density" : 5 }
  - Example:
    { "min" : 6000, "max" : 9500, "density" : 2 },
    { "min" : 3500, "max" : 6000, "density" : 5 },
    { "min" : 1000, "max" : 2000, "density" : 3 }
  - Example:
    { "min" : 25000, "max" : 29000, "density" : 5 },
    { "min" : 10000, "max" : 22000, "density" : 3 },
    { "min" : 1000, "max" : 1700, "density" : 1 }
  - Example:
    { "min" : 15000, "max" : 20000, "density" : 1 },
    { "min" : 10000, "max" : 15000, "density" : 6 },
    { "min" : 3000, "max" : 6000, "density" : 9 }
